We're carefully monitoring and considering advice from government and health officials in the communities where our employees live and work, and we will continue to support our customers and normal business operations.

Our customer care team will continue to provide consistent and reliable support from 8AM-8PM EST 5 days a week. Technical support will also continue throughout this time.
